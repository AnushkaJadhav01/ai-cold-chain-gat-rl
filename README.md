# AI-Driven Multi-Depot Cold Chain Optimization (GAT-RL)

This project proposes an AI-based cold chain optimization system using 
Graph Attention Networks (GAT) combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) 
to minimize spoilage, reduce logistics cost, and improve delivery efficiency.

## Problem Statement
India’s cold chain logistics face high spoilage rates due to inefficient 
routing, poor coordination between depots, and lack of real-time intelligence.

## Solution Overview
The proposed system models the cold chain network as a graph and applies 
GAT-based representation learning with RL-driven decision-making to 
optimize routing, allocation, and scheduling across multiple depots.
